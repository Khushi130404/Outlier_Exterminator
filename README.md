# Outlier_Exterminator

Outlier_Exterminator is a Python-based tool designed to handle and process outliers in datasets. It provides implementations of the Interquartile Range (IQR), Z-Score, and Percentile methods to detect and treat outliers. The tool supports various outlier treatment techniques, including trimming, capping, and Winsorization.

This project is developed and demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook for ease of use and understanding.
